Refactoring html and css

The project involves fixing a website that poorly used html and css elements. Going the extra mile to enhance the code without loosing 
visual asthetics. From this project i learned the importance of organizing html elements in a logical order without breaking the styles for the page.

## Installation

N/A

## Features

The site came with a broken navigation link (Search Engine Optimization) which would break when the user clicked on it.
This was fixed by correcting the error in the HTML section 

A lot of redundant css was removed and condensed to enhance site performance (About 62 lines of repeated code)...
