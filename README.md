Refactoring HTML and CSS

The project involves fixing a website that poorly used HTML and CSS elements and attributes to enhance the code without loosing 
visual asthetics. Thanks to this project i learned the importance of reorganizing html elements in a logical order without breaking the styles for the page.

The site came with a broken navigation link (Search Engine Optimization) which would break when the user clicked on it. This was fixed by correcting the error in the HTML section.

Initially, there was a lot of use of non-semantic elements which negatively impacted the readability of the code. This was remedied by using Nav, Article, Aside, Section, and footer elements to better represent the structure.

Creative alt attributes were added to image tags and the overall flow of the CSS was changed to improve consistency and readability.
A lot of redundant css was removed and condensed to enhance site performance (About 62 lines of repeated code).
